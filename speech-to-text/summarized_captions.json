In the worst case with 32 concurrent submissions the average request took about 10 seconds the slowest ones took about 19 seconds. I think it's fair to say that our system can handle at least 90 requests per minute.", "Video1_2014-04-06T00:00:06": "frankly this is going to be more than enough with the amount of traffic that I get now switching over to the UI this was definitely the most annoying part I just hate front end development in general especially because I write pretty much all the CSS on my site and the most interesting part was probably the code editor. I literally had to set up a custom webpack config which is not something you normally have to do with angular projects and even then I still had issues that just drove me crazy.", "Video1_2014-04-06T00:00:08": "software development yeah some algorithms definitely are hard as hell but at least you don't have to deal with random BS like this. I also thought that I would easily be able to customize the editor theme to get it to look exactly like BS code but even that is actually a lot more complicated than I thought. maybe I can explain how I did that in a future video or maybe a course or something like that now for the process of actually adding a new problem so far for the problems I've added the user is asked to design a day to structure which is encapsulated in a class.", "Video2_2014-04-06T00:00:00": "get into the class and then comparing the output with the expected output there's a lot of ways you can probably do this you can even use like a unit testing framework probably but I tried to keep things as simple as possible.

The biggest shortcut I probably took and don't tell your Tech lead I told you this but I actually didn't write unit tests at least in my case I think it's a waste of time because I already know like the entire code base.", "Video2_2014-04-06T00:00:08": "Channel but maybe just maybe there is some correlation with being good at solving leetcode problems especially leet code hard and being a good developer. I see people on Twitter complaining about next js13 oh no the app router it's so complicated guys like I've been doing angular and I'm not saying that like it's a good thing but I'm just saying that maybe being a real Dev isn't as hard as people make it out to be."}
